**Self review**

Hello, I decided to make a gadget review page. I got the code working pretty fast, mostly done on friday, jsut a few fiddly bits that took me more time and then the css took me a while on this one. I tried to use tailwind a bit and found it a bit awkward in places as some css commands don't seem to transfer? so it feels a bit frankenstiened on styling.

I really wanted to try some framer motion stuff, particularly on the butons, but just ran out of time .

Generally I felt like this project started to come together easier, i don't know if its because next and react are just easier or i'm actually taking things in more and understanding the code even if i'm not remembering it all but things go wrong and I automatically think oh it could be this and then amange to figure things out quite well so i'm happy about that.

I didn't get a chance to do the stretch goals but I have in the week been setting up search and sort function and on my previous project as I wanted to get it to a stage I was happy with so I feel that I do know how to do some of these things.

I had a struggle with my comment form covering up my comments as i'd set the form to stick to the bottom of the page. I thought i'd fixed this and then I looked at mobile size and realised that its covering it. i'm not sure how to fix this so any help there would be appreciated!
